        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details and restricting direct access to the object's data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It ensures that data is protected from unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access to data is controlled through getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inheritance**\n",
        "Inheritance allows a child class to acquire the properties and behaviors of a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps in establishing relationships between classes (e.g., parent-child hierarchy).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\", where the same method or function behaves differently based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (redefining parent class methods in the child class).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in dynamic method resolution and flexible code design.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details while exposing only the essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows working with high-level concepts rather than complex underlying code.\n",
        "\n",
